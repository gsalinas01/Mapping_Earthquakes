# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
  * The purpose of this project is to create a visual representation of earthquake data through interactive maps.
  * I utilized my knowledge of javascript and the d3 library to work with the leaflet library, a mapbox API, and GeoJSON data from the USGS website to create a visually appealing and interactive map. 

## Results
  * The result is a multi-layer map with toggle options for different visualization of earthquake data and tectonic plates.
